## üß† About LumaOS

**LumaOS** is a **32-bit x86 toy operating system** written in C and Assembly, designed as a self-teaching tool for understanding how operating systems work at a low level.

Inspired by well-known OS development resources like **James Molloy's tutorials**, **OSDev Wiki**, and **BrokenThorn's Kernel Series**, LumaOS is crafted from scratch, with the intent of eventually evolving into a lightweight and innovative operating system.

This open-source project is being built with a long-term vision for **commercial licensing**, advanced modules, and developer add-ons.

## üåü Why LumaOS?

LumaOS isn‚Äôt just another toy kernel‚Äîit‚Äôs a project designed to evolve into:

* A **powerful educational toolkit** for systems programming students
* A **lightweight modular OS** for hobbyists and retro hardware
* A **commercializable platform** with extended GUI, drivers, networking, and sandboxing in the roadmap
* A playground for developers to **build low-level apps**, file systems, and games
